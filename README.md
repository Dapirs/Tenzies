# Tenzies 🎲

A **single-player Tenzies game** built with modern web tools. Roll dice, “lock” numbers, and try to get all dice showing the same value — with as few rolls as possible.

## 🚀 Features

- Click any die to “freeze” it (i.e. don’t re-roll)  
- Game ends when all dice show the same number  
- Tracks number of rolls  
- Reset / Play again  
- Responsive UI (works on mobile & desktop)  
- Lightweight & fast — built with Vite + vanilla JS / your stack
